You can call fns with both with just name or name() while events. Vue accepts both.

Vue built in $event. Here in case if we want to pass lastName then in methods we will not get event as first parameter, so using below: 
<input type="text" v-on:input="setName($event, 'SHAH')" />

Modifying events(event modifiers) like prevent default form behavior, other way to do is manally make a method while submitting and prevent it.
<form v-on:submit.prevent>
    <input type="text" />
    <button>Sign Up</button>
</form>

v-once directive use when you want to preserve the original value even if it changes.
